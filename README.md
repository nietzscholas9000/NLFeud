TODO:
upload old/stable version - current operations have temporarily disabled comparison method

swap between sets and lists and other data structures to test efficiency
>verify type compatibility of comparison operands

Will have to re-run and test code on new methods and structures I have learned since original development.
    
>review literature on comparison methods
>develop a neural network to make comparison

comparison method:
  comparison_algorithm(guess):
    
    
   return boolean true for guess in guess list
    
    


Create functions to better organize Q/A comparison method (may aid testing)..
