Develop tests to check flexibility of comparison method over known variations of Q/A.

   Will have to re-run and test code on new methods and structures I have learned since original development.
    
>review literature on comparison methods

comparison method:
  comparison_algorithm(guess):
    
    
   return boolean true for guess in guess list
    
    


Create functions to better organize Q/A comparison method (may aid testing)..
