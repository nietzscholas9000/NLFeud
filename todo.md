TODO:
upload old/stable version - current operations have temporarily disabled comparison method

swap between sets and lists and other data structures to test efficiency
>verify type compatibility of comparison operands

Will have to re-run and test code on new methods and structures I have learned since original development.
    
review literature on word comparison methods, develop NN for comparison. 
is this a proto-method or a new approach? review natural language programming literature

Create functions to better organize Q/A comparison method (may aid testing)..
